# Controllers, Routes, and Views
  **Controller**: coordinates the interaction between the user, the model, and views (directs our app)
  **Route**: how the user gets somewhere in our application
  **View**: what the user sees
  **URL**: Uniform Resource Locator
 --------------------------------
```bash
  $ rails generate controller Home
```
generated a views/home folder for us
 - we add a file (view) with .html.erb
