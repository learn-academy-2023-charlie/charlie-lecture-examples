# Controllers, Routes, and Views

### Controller: coordinates the interaction between the user, the model, and views (directs our app)
<br/>

### Route: how the user gets somewhere in our application
<br/>

### View: what the user sees
<br/>

### URL: Uniform Resource Locator

 --------------------------------

```bash
  $ rails generate controller Home
```
generated a views/home folder for us
 - we add a file (view) with .html.erb
