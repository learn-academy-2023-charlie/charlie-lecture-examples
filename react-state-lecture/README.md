# React State Lecture

- App.js is heavy hitter (parent component) and will display our content and other components to our browser
- React fragments allow us to return one container with as many things inside as we want
- functional components are a function with an export to be found
- other components are to be stored in components folder and they are referred to as the child / children components
- logic stored in a child component will then be passed to the parent component (imported)
- inline styling is an option vs css file
- style is an attribute that can be passed to a tag to add more information
